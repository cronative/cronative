Expert in development for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Android, Android TV, Roku TV, and Desktop apps using Swift, SwiftUI, Objective C, RxSwift, Roku, Flutter, React Native, and Kotlin.

In my 7+ year developer journey, I have built and improved dozens of successful applications for clients in social networking, health, finance, education, entertainment, self-help, fitness, eCommerce, live streaming, media and many other fields.

How can I help you:
- Build an app from ideation to MVP and beyond
- Revive, update or fix existing applications in need of care and feeding
- Integrate new or existing applications into popular backends like firebase, AWS etc
- Get previously stalled app development efforts over the finish line
- Consult on feature possibilities, app store guidelines, and monetization strategies
- Perform code reviews, automation testing etc.

I will provide the following:
- Daily Update/discussion
- Daily commit on Git repo
- Work 40 hours per week or as needed
- Bug-free, clean and easy-to-understand code
- Unit testing

I have a group of experts who can build web applications, design and back-end servers using AWS, DevOps, WordPress, ReactJS, NodeJS, PHP, Angular, HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript and many others, so if you need any solutions in web design and development, UI/UX design and WordPress then we can do this with the help of my groups, so you should not waste time searching.

For every client, I propose my ideas about how to improve and make more profitable client iOS and Android applications.

My science interest is machine learning, neural networks, big data, data mining, and Image processing. I have worked with these technologies and I will be happy to use them in iOS and Android applications.

If you have an idea that needs to be developed into an application or an existing application that requires some refinements, approvals, extensions, fixes and converting from one platform to another. In that case, I will provide a full application review along with the report and further estimate the necessary fixes, improvements, etc.

Robust technology and business experience combine for strong project results, no matter the size. I welcome discussing your projects and helping you find success!
